# Project knowledge update log

## 2026-09-05

- **Public documentation boundary and presentation**: Made README and rendered
  docs strictly user-only, removed architecture and roadmap pages from the
  public tree, and selected the nuqs notebook-style Fumadocs layout as the
  primary visual reference while keeping CoCo's own branding and prose.
- **First executable Rust slice**: Wired `cocod`, `coco`, and `coco-mcp` to the
  coordinator. Repository registration, native worktree/task creation, Codex
  thread and turn startup, durable events, observation, retry protection, and
  failure retention now run through the local daemon boundary.
- **Repository command**: Selected `coco repo add [path]` and the
  `repository.register` daemon method instead of the ambiguous `coco init`.
- **Codex execution profiles**: Named profiles now resolve from
  `[profiles.<name>]` in `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml`, while only a redacted
  effective snapshot is persisted per task.
- **Static public documentation**: Fixed GitHub Pages as the deployment target
  for the future Next.js/Fumadocs site. The site must use a fully static
  export, client-side static search, project-subpath-safe assets and routes,
  and a GitHub Actions Pages deployment of only the generated `out/` artifact.
- **Worker MCP architecture**: Made CoCo authoritative for the future MCP
  catalog, capability profiles, and immutable thread bindings. Selected native
  Codex MCP configuration as the first runtime projection and explicitly
  excluded building a custom CoCo proxy.
- **Agentgateway boundary**: Documented Agentgateway as a compatible future
  data-plane adapter for federation and independent policy enforcement. It is
  not a current dependency or planned delivery item.
- **Rust migration**: Replaced the initial TypeScript/Node implementation
  direction with a single Rust crate using Tokio while retaining SQLite,
  native Git worktrees, and the Codex App Server over `stdio`.
- **CoCo v0 contract**: Added the concrete product specification, including
  task/thread/worktree invariants, CLI and MCP contracts, lifecycle states,
  normalized events, safety requirements, acceptance tests, and explicit
  assumptions.
- **Architecture**: Added the headless `cocod` topology and boundaries between
  CLI/MCP adapters, SQLite, Git worktrees, and the Codex App Server.
- **Implementation baseline (superseded)**: Initially recorded Node.js 24,
  pnpm, Nix flakes, SQLite, generated local App Server bindings, and a first
  local RPC direction; the Rust migration later the same day superseded the
  language/runtime portion of this entry.
- **Initialization**: Established the internal knowledge bundle and separated
  public product documentation from maintainer and agent context.
- **Branch workflow**: Required one working document per branch, with the full
  branch name mirrored below `knowledge/work/`.
- **Public documentation**: Selected a customized Next.js, Fumadocs, MDX, and
  Tailwind direction inspired by Orca's public documentation, explicitly
  excluding Astro Starlight.
