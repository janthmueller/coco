# main — repository foundation

## Intended outcome

Establish the repository, documentation workflow, and first executable and
architectural baseline for CoCo.

## Active work

- [x] Initialize the repository on `main`.
- [x] Review Wuf's public/internal documentation boundary and agent guidance.
- [x] Establish a required working document for every branch and task.
- [x] Inspect Orca's public documentation and record the intended site stack
  and visual qualities.
- [x] Read and classify the CoCo product handoff.
- [x] Switch the implementation baseline from TypeScript to Rust at the user's
  direction.
- [x] Establish the initial Rust domain, persistence, Git, RPC, Codex client,
  profile, CLI, and control-MCP modules.
- [x] Evaluate per-thread worker MCP selection and Agentgateway.
- [x] Document CoCo-owned MCP registry/bindings, native Codex as the initial
  runtime, and Agentgateway as a deferred optional adapter.
- [x] Record static export and GitHub Pages as mandatory constraints for the
  eventual user-facing documentation.
- [x] Complete the first Rust vertical slice through repository registration,
  worktree creation, and Codex thread/turn startup.
- [x] Scaffold the public Next.js/Fumadocs site and its initial user-facing
  guides, concepts, reference, and integration pages.
- [ ] Verify the complete static export at both `/` and the GitHub Pages
  project subpath, including browser-side search and the public-only boundary.
- [ ] Add Nix apps and development-shell tooling for installing, checking,
  building, serving, and developing the documentation site.
- [ ] Record the planned detached-worktree creation mode without presenting it
  as current behavior.
- [ ] Replace the first public site draft: it exposed internal architecture and
  roadmap material and did not meet the strict user-facing boundary.
- [ ] Separate task preparation from execution: `coco new` must not require or
  start a goal, while `coco send` starts the first and later turns.
- [ ] Replace the overlapping `show`/`watch` UX with a concise one-shot
  `coco status` and an explicit live `coco status --follow` mode.
- [ ] Add `coco jump` so an operator can open the existing Codex thread in its
  managed worktree through the same App Server observed by `cocod`.
- [ ] Replace the temporary Unix-only shared App Server listener with an
  authenticated loopback-WebSocket endpoint that `coco jump` can use on Linux,
  macOS, and Windows.
- [ ] Keep CoCo's CLI-to-daemon transport behind a local-IPC boundary: Unix
  sockets on Linux/macOS and a Windows named-pipe backend, without duplicating
  protocol or coordinator logic.
- [ ] Create safe checkpoint commits as the foundation and subsequent vertical
  slices become independently buildable.

## Decisions

- 2026-09-05 — Use a progressively disclosed `knowledge/` bundle for durable
  maintainer context, keeping public documentation focused on users.
- 2026-09-05 — Mirror full branch names below `knowledge/work/` so every task
  record is unambiguous and parallel branches normally touch different files.
- 2026-09-05 — Use Next.js, Fumadocs, MDX, and Tailwind for the eventual public
  site. This follows the structure and visual restraint of Orca's docs rather
  than Wuf's Astro Starlight implementation.
- 2026-09-05 — Supersede Orca as the visual reference with nuqs' open-source
  Fumadocs package: use its monochrome notebook layout, top navigation,
  centered search, flat sidebar, reading width, and typographic rhythm while
  retaining CoCo's branding and content.
- 2026-09-05 — Defer the actual site scaffold, package versions, navigation,
  and branding to a separately scheduled documentation milestone after the
  first public behavior is stable.
- 2026-09-05 — Use a single Rust crate with Tokio instead of the initial
  TypeScript/Node direction.
- 2026-09-05 — Keep worker execution profiles and MCP capability profiles as
  separate immutable snapshot dimensions, with optional presets joining them
  for user-facing convenience.
- 2026-09-05 — CoCo owns the future MCP catalog and per-thread bindings. The
  first runtime projection uses native Codex MCP configuration; CoCo will not
  build a custom MCP proxy.
- 2026-09-05 — Preserve an adapter boundary for Agentgateway, but do not add it
  as a dependency or roadmap item yet.
- 2026-09-05 — The Fumadocs application must use Next.js static export and be
  deployed through GitHub Actions to GitHub Pages. It may not require a Node.js
  server at runtime.
- 2026-09-05 — Spell repository registration `coco repo add [path]`; the nested
  namespace leaves room for later `repo list`, `repo show`, and `repo remove`
  commands without an ambiguous top-level `init`.
- 2026-09-05 — Resolve a named execution profile from
  `[profiles.<name>]` in `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml` and project that overlay into
  `thread/start.config`. The full overlay stays in memory; SQLite receives only
  its identity/hash and the App Server's allowlisted effective settings.
- 2026-09-05 — Use cursor-based `event.list` polling for the first `watch`
  implementation. Live subscription remains a compatible later transport
  optimization rather than a prerequisite for durable observation.
- 2026-09-05 — Position CoCo concretely as the coordinator of Codex tasks and
  their Git working areas. Codex App Server owns threads and turns in a caller-
  supplied `cwd`; CoCo owns repository registration, worktree lifecycle, the
  durable task binding, and client-independent orchestration.
- 2026-09-05 — Make the public/internal documentation boundary an explicit
  acceptance gate. Every rendered page must help a user evaluate, operate, or
  troubleshoot shipped behavior; architecture, rationale, roadmaps, gateway
  evaluation, and agent work remain exclusively under `knowledge/`.
- 2026-09-05 — Use one local Codex App Server listener over a private Unix
  socket for both `cocod` and interactive `coco jump` clients. A standalone
  `codex resume` process would bypass CoCo's event projection; sharing the App
  Server lets the TUI own interaction while the daemon remains subscribed to
  thread and turn notifications. Pin and contract-test the Codex version
  because the remote transport is currently documented as experimental.
- 2026-09-05 — Supersede the Unix-only App Server endpoint with an
  authenticated loopback WebSocket. Codex CLI supports the same `--remote`
  endpoint on native Windows, Linux, and macOS, whereas Codex does not expose a
  Windows named-pipe listener. Keep the capability token in private local
  runtime state and pass it to interactive clients through an environment
  variable rather than command-line arguments.
- 2026-09-05 — Do not force one transport across unrelated boundaries. CoCo's
  own privileged local RPC should use OS-native local IPC through one abstract
  interface (Unix sockets or Windows named pipes); the shared Codex App Server
  uses its cross-platform loopback-WebSocket surface because Codex TUI must
  connect to it directly.

## Findings

- Wuf separates its concise README and user site from an internal OKF knowledge
  bundle, with `AGENTS.md` acting as a short router into that material.
- The relevant Orca reference is `stablyai/orca`. Its public docs render with
  Next.js and Fumadocs conventions and use MDX-oriented, grouped navigation.
- The installed `codex-cli 0.147.0` App Server does not accept CLI
  `--profile`; CoCo must resolve named profiles into per-thread configuration
  overlays when sharing one App Server process.
- Locally generated App Server schemas expose `config` on thread start,
  resume, and fork. Runtime isolation of different MCP selections still needs
  a pinned-version contract test before implementation depends on it.
- Agentgateway can federate MCP targets and filter tools by tool/target and
  authenticated claims, but strict per-thread policy on one endpoint requires
  a thread-distinguishing identity.
- Fumadocs documents a static search/build path, while Next.js emits the
  deployable `out/` tree with `output: "export"`. A GitHub project Pages site
  also requires build-time subpath handling rather than root-relative
  assumptions.
- The official Codex SDK/App Server surface starts, resumes, and forks thread
  history in a caller-supplied `cwd`; the documented managed-worktree creation,
  handoff, snapshot, and cleanup behavior belongs to the desktop application.
- The initial Fumadocs draft violated the repository's existing audience
  boundary by exposing architecture and future-integration material. A clean
  static build did not make that content suitable for users; the public
  information architecture and link verification both require correction.
- Native Codex CLI now supports Windows directly. The present CoCo executable
  remains Unix-only because its RPC listener is implemented with Tokio Unix
  sockets; the daemon concept itself is not platform-specific.
- The executable coordinator now serializes creation and turn-start operations
  per repository, resolves client paths back to a registered Git common
  directory, and treats Git/Codex effects as persisted saga steps.
- App Server requests are surfaced as redacted durable events and are never
  auto-approved. The approval response workflow remains intentionally open.

## Verification

- `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` returned `true`.
- `git branch --show-current` returned `main`.
- All expected local documentation targets exist.
- Every non-index knowledge document has the required frontmatter and a
  non-empty `type`.
- The new MCP architecture document is linked from the engineering index and
  `AGENTS.md`; targeted trailing-whitespace checks are clean.
- `cargo test --locked --all-targets` passes all 35 tests, including native Git
  worktrees, SQLite recovery, Codex framing, RPC sockets, MCP delegation, task
  creation/retry, event normalization, and post-worktree failure retention.
- `cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` and
  `cargo fmt --all -- --check` pass.
- `nix flake check path:. --no-write-lock-file` passes.
- A process-level smoke test with isolated temporary state started `cocod`,
  initialized the installed Codex App Server, and registered this checkout via
  `coco repo add .` over the real Unix socket. No model turn was started.

## Open questions and handoff

- Prove native Codex per-thread MCP isolation across start, resume, and fork
  before scheduling the registry feature.
- Agentgateway is deliberately not scheduled. Reconsider it only when
  federation, centralized credential custody, independent enforcement, or
  gateway observability becomes an actual requirement.
- Add a safe approval-response command and durable pending-request model before
  calling v0 generally usable.
- Add daemon recovery through `thread/resume`; the first slice conservatively
  marks in-flight work interrupted after daemon loss.
- When the public site is scheduled, validate its production export under the
  GitHub Pages project subpath before enabling deployment from `main`.
